## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Workflow <!-- :gear: -->

1. ✅ Code is pushed to the `main` branch. <!-- :white_check_mark: -->
2. 🚀 GitHub Actions triggers an automated pipeline. <!-- :rocket: -->
3. 🔧 Source code is linted, tested, and validated. <!-- :wrench: -->
4. 🐳 Docker image is built and tagged. <!-- :whale: -->
5. 📦 Image is pushed to Docker Hub. <!-- :package: -->
6. ☁️ Image is deployed to AWS (manual or automated deployment). <!-- :cloud: -->
7. 📩 Optional: Send status notifications or monitoring hooks. <!-- :envelope_with_arrow: -->
